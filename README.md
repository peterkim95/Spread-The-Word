Spread The Word
===============

####Information is King

**Spread The Word** is a simple and empowering way to spread information to the people around you. On the receiveing end, you can read words that are the most relevant and popular in your area.


#####How is this different from Twitter?

With Twitter, unless you're a celebrity, you become irrelevant in the sea of tweets from the very start. It is only your friends that make your tweets relevant and be heard. Autmoatically, the information you spread is limited to the scope of your friends. But what if there were no such limitations? No boundaries on who your tweets can reach. **Spread The Word** presents this freedom.

From the moment you start using **Spread The Word**, every one of the people around your location becomes your audience. Your words are not judged by normal social network conventions. You do not have a profile or a friends list; you are anonymous. You are only identified and recognized by the words you spread. So, it doesn't matter if you're a Hollywood Star or homeless. The more relevant, interesting, funny, attractive, and engaging information wins. Always. On **Spread The Word**, information is king.
